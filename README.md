# dom-performance-optimizer

A kit based on different libraries that allow you to improve the performance of your site
(in frontend side). Thank you very much to [Wilson Page](https://twitter.com/wilsonpage), he creates fastdom library,
this library is based on fastdom but it's not the main purpose of this library to only help
with layout thrashing.

You can download [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alanjo4/dom-Performance-Optimizer/main/index.js) or
if you want a version compatible with es5 feature, then you can download the repo and then run
```
npm install
npm run build
```
And babel will generate an ES5 compatible file.
